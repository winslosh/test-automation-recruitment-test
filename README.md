Test Automation Recruitment Test
==================================

:rocket:Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test. It consists of two parts::rocket:

* [A technical test](https://github.com/winslosh/test-automation-recruitment-test/blob/main/README.md#computertechnical-test)
* [A few technical questions](https://github.com/winslosh/test-automation-recruitment-test/blob/main/README.md#speech_balloontechnical-questions)

### Before You Start
You will be committing your code and answers to your repo on [GitHub](http://github.com) so you will need to create an account if you do not already have one. 



# :computer:Technical Test

We have a [demo ecommerce](http://104.42.251.168/) site that you will be using.

The Technical test consists of 2 tasks:

**Task 1. Write test cases for the below feature / scenarios.**

		       Feature: Allow user to register on the site
				As a user of the registration page of the demo website
				When I provide valid unique credentials
				An account is created for me
			  
		      Scenario: Invalid credentials
				As a user of the registration page of the demo website
				When I provide an email that has already been used in the system
				I see an appropriate error message


**Task 2.** `Add two more test cases which you feel would enhance the test coverage of the site`.


### :file_folder:Platform Choice

You can use any testing framework / language you are experienced with

### Task requirements

Feel free to spend as much or as little time on the exercise as you like as long as the following requirements have been met.  

- Complete the two tasks described above.
- You should provide clear instructions on your test setup and how to execute your tests. The clarity and precision of these instructions - and the ease with which the interviewers can execute them - will be a key part of the assessment. 
- Create a README file detailing said instructions. 
- Please also use this README for listing any additional comments or observations you might want to share about your submission.

# :speech_balloon:Technical Questions

**Answer the following questions in a markdown file called** `Answers to technical questions.md`.

1. How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
2. What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?
3. How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?

## :trophy:Finished?
